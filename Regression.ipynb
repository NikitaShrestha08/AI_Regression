The objective is to predict a continuous molecular property (such as **monoisotopic mass**) from other available numerical descriptors. The pipeline covers data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, neural network implementation, classical ML model building, hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and a final comparative analysis."

        "**Source & Access:**\n",
        "- The dataset contains comprehensive information about pharmaceutical compounds, including molecular properties, pharmacological data, and drug interaction information\n",
        "- Sourced from the DrugBank database (https://go.drugbank.com/), one of the most widely used free drug databases\n",
        "- DrugBank was originally published in 2006 by Dr. David Wishart and collaborators at the University of Alberta, Canada\n",
        "- **Size:** 16,762 rows and 40 columns covering a wide range of drug-related attributes\n",

        "### Dataset Quality Assessment\n",
        "- **Missing Values:** Significant -- every column has missing values. The two key numeric columns (`average-mass`, `monoisotopic-mass`) have 5,176 missing values each (30.9%). Many text columns have 80-95% missing values.\n",
        "- **Numeric Features:** Only 3 truly numeric columns exist (`ahfs-codes` is entirely null, leaving effectively just `average-mass` and `monoisotopic-mass`). Additional numeric-like data may be encoded in text fields like `pdb-entries`, `enzymes`, etc.\n",
        "- **Data Types:** Predominantly string/text (37 columns), with only 3 float columns. This is a highly text-heavy dataset that requires careful preprocessing.\n",
        "- **Relevance:** Highly relevant for pharmaceutical research and aligns directly with SDG 3."

        "Three regression models were built and evaluated on the DrugBank dataset (16,762 total entries, ~11,586 usable after removing rows with null target values):\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Neural Network (MLP Regressor):** The two-layer architecture (64->32 neurons) with ReLU activation and Adam optimizer captured non-linear molecular relationships. Its performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Random Forest Regressor** generally outperformed Ridge Regression, achieving lower RMSE and higher R-squared scores. This is expected as Random Forest can model non-linear relationships between molecular descriptors and the target property, and is robust to the outliers common in molecular mass data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Ridge Regression** (regularized linear model) provided a strong baseline. Given the near-perfect linear correlation between `average-mass` and `monoisotopic-mass`, the linear model also achieved excellent performance. Ridge's advantage over plain Linear Regression is its L2 regularization, which stabilizes coefficients when features are correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Impact of Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cross-Validation\n",
        "5-fold cross-validation was essential for:\n",
        "- **Reliable generalization estimates**: Averaging across 5 different train/validation splits gives a more trustworthy R-squared estimate than a single split\n",
        "- **Robust hyperparameter selection**: Ensures the chosen parameters work well across different subsets of the data, not just one favorable split\n",
        "- **Detecting overfitting**: If a model's CV score is much lower than its training score, it signals overfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "### Feature Selection\n",
        "Using SelectFromModel with Random Forest:\n",
        "- **Identified the most predictive features** -- `average-mass` was confirmed as the dominant predictor, consistent with domain knowledge (average mass and monoisotopic mass are mathematically closely related)\n",
        "- **Reduced model complexity** by retaining only important features, reducing the risk of overfitting on noise\n",
        "- **Maintained or improved performance** -- removing unimportant features often slightly improves generalization\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
        "GridSearchCV systematically found optimal model configurations:\n",
        "- For Ridge Regression, it identified the optimal regularization strength (`alpha`) and solver\n",
        "- For Random Forest, it tuned the number of trees, depth, and splitting criteria\n",
        "- In both cases, tuned models show improvement over default-parameter versions\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Strong Linear Relationship**: The near-perfect correlation between `average-mass` and `monoisotopic-mass` means even simple linear models achieve high R-squared. This is expected from chemistry -- both metrics measure molecular mass using slightly different isotope weighting.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Non-linearity Exists**: Despite the strong linear trend, Random Forest's superior performance suggests subtle non-linear patterns exist, possibly due to molecular composition differences (e.g., heavy elements introduce larger isotope-weighting deviations).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model Selection Trade-Off**: Ridge Regression offers better interpretability (clear coefficients) while Random Forest offers better accuracy. The choice depends on whether the goal is prediction accuracy or understanding the underlying relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Challenges**: The DrugBank dataset is predominantly text-based (37 out of 40 columns are strings). Extracting more numeric features from these text fields (e.g., parsing half-life values, protein-binding percentages) could significantly improve model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Future Directions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Feature Engineering from Text**: Parse numeric values from text columns (e.g., extract half-life hours from half-life text descriptions, protein-binding percentages) to create additional predictive features\n",
        "2. **Gradient Boosting**: Try XGBoost or LightGBM, which often outperform both Random Forest and linear models on tabular data\n",
        "3. **Deep Learning with Molecular Fingerprints**: Use molecular structure representations (SMILES strings, fingerprints) as input to specialized neural networks\n",
        "4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine Ridge, Random Forest, and MLP predictions through stacking for potentially improved accuracy\n",
        "5. **External Validation**: Test on completely independent drug datasets (e.g., ChEMBL, PubChem) to verify model generalizability"
